[[Cat senses]] fit a [[crepuscular]] and predatory [[ecological niche]]. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in [[frequency]] for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer [[color vision]] and a better [[Olfaction|sense of smell]] than humans.\n\nDespite being solitary hunters, cats are a [[social animal|social species]], and [[cat communication]] includes the use of a variety of [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s ([[Cat communication|mewing]], [[purr]]ing, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, [[growling]], and [[Guttural|grunting]]), as well as [[cat pheromone]]s, and types of [[Cat body language|cat-specific body language]].<ref name=\"Moelk\" />\n\nCats have a high breeding rate.
