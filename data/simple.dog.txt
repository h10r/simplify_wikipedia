It has been [[domestication|domesticated]] by humans for a long time. It was the first animal ever to be domesticated. Dogs are used by humans for many different things, for work and as [[pet]]s. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the [[United States]] are [[wikt:register|registered]] as [[pet]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title= Family Flip Quiz Geography|last= Gifford|first= Clive|authorlink= |coauthors= Lisa Clayden|year= 2002|publisher= Miles Kelly Publishing|location= Bardfield Centre, Great Bardfield, Essex, CM7 4SL|isbn= 1-84236-146-5|pages= |url= }}</ref> Dogs eat both meat and vegetables, often mixed together and sold in stores as [[dog food]]. Dogs often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, seeing eye dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs and sheepdogs.\n\nThey are sometimes called \"canines\" from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for dog - ''canis''. Sometimes people also use \"dog\" to describe other [[canid]]s, such as [[wolf|wolves]]. A baby dog is called a '''pup''' or '''puppy'''. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old.\n\nDogs are sometimes referred to as \"man's best friend\" because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans.\n\n== Appearance and behaviour ==\n\nDogs can smell and hear very well, but cannot see well in [[color]], or they are [[color blindness|color blind]]. Dogs have four legs and make a \"bark,\" \"woof,\" or \"arf\" sound. Dogs often chase [[cat]]s, and most dogs will [[wikt:fetch|fetch]] a ball or stick.\n\nDogs usually live about 10 years or more. The size and the breed of the dog may change how long the dog lives. Smaller dog breeds usually live longer.<ref>http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/good-dogs-live-longer.html</ref>\n\nLike wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called [[pack (canine)|packs]]. Packs of dogs are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank will submit to other dogs with higher rank. The highest ranked dog is called the [[alpha male]]. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Domesticated dogs often view their owner as the alpha male. {{fact|date=April 2014}}\n\n== Origin of dogs ==\nAll dogs are descended from [[wolf|wolves]],which of the wolves come from are the dire wolves. They're wolves, but dire. Which has happened due to [[domestication]] and [[artificial selection]]. This is known because [[DNA]] [[genome]] [[wikt:analysis|analysis]] has been done to discover this.<ref>Lindblad-Toh K, Wade CM, Mikkelsen TS ''et al.'' 2005.

The earliest known [[fossil]] of a domestic dog is from 31,700 years ago in [[Belgium]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27240370 World's first dog lived 31,700 years ago, ate big] Jennifer Viegas, Discovery News, 10/17/2008</ref>\n\n== Dogs and humans ==\nDogs have lived with people for at least 30,000 years.{{fact|date=October 2013}} They are often called \"man's best [[friend]]\" because they fit in with human life. Dogs can serve people in many ways. For example, there are [[guard dog]]s, [[hunting dog]]s, [[herding dog]]s, and [[guide dog]]s for [[blind]] people. There are also dogs that are trained to smell for diseases in the human body or to find bombs or [[illegal drugs]]. These dogs sometimes help police in airports or other areas. Sniffer dogs (usually [[beagle]]s) are sometimes trained for this job. Dogs have even been sent by [[Russia]]ns into [[outer space]], a few years before any human being. The first dog sent up was called Laika, but died while there.\n\n== Dog breeds ==\n[[File:Big_and_little_dog_1.jpg|thumb|200px|Dogs are bred into very different breeds: here a [[Great Dane]] and a small [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]].]]\n:''See also [[List of dog breeds]].''\nThere are at least 800 [[list of dog breeds|breeds]] (kinds) of dogs. Dogs whose parents were the same breed will also be that breed: these dogs are called [[purebred]] or pure [[pedigree]] dogs. Dogs with parents from different breeds no longer belong to one breed: they are called ''mutts'', ''[[mixed-breed dog]]s'', ''[[hybrid]]s'', or ''mongrels''. Some of the most popular breeds are sheepdogs, collies, [[poodle]]s and retrievers. It is becoming popular to breed together two different breeds of dogs and call the new dog's breed a name that is a mixture of the parents' breeds' two names. A puppy with a poodle and a pomeranian as parents might be called a Pomapoo. These kinds of dogs, instead of being called mutts, are known as designer dog breeds. These dogs are normally used for prize shows and designer shows.\nThey can be guide dogs.\n\n== Photogallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:A Golden Retriever-9 (Barras).JPG|[[Golden Retriever]]\nFile:Betty the Boxer.jpg|[[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]]\nFile:Dob-3ans.jpg|[[Dobermann]]\nFile:2 yr old Dalmatian.jpg|[[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]]\nFile:Briard 2 jaar.JPG|[[Briard]]\nFile:Scottish terrier .jpg|[[Scottish Terrier]]\nFile:Cachorro de Bichon Maltes.JPG|[[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Related pages==\n*[[The Puppy Bowl]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n\n{{Link FA|ca}}\n{{Link FA|ml}}\n{{Link FA|no}}\n{{Link FA|pt}}"}]}}}}
