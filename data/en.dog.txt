If dogs were domesticated, as believed, roughly 15,000 years ago, the event (or events) would have coincided with a large expansion in human territory and the development of agriculture. This has led some biologists to suggest one of the forces that led to the domestication of dogs was a shift in human lifestyle in the form of established human settlements. Permanent settlements would have coincided with a greater amount of disposable food and would have created a barrier between wild and anthropogenic canine populations.<ref name=\"miklosi\"/>\n\nIn

In one study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that, when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were then allowed to interact with the box.

Regurgitating of food by the females for the young as well as care for the young by the males has been observed in domestic dogs, [[dingo]]s as well as in other feral or semi-feral dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females and direct choosing of only one mate has been observed even in those semi-feral dogs of direct domestic dog ancestry. Also regurgitating of food by males has been observed in free-ranging domestic dogs.<ref name=\"Pal\"/><ref>Eberhard Trumler, Mit dem Hund auf du; Zum Verst\u00e4ndnis seines Wesens und Verhaltens; 4.
